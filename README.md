#  Closed loop DBS computational model implemented on iCub robot
## Docker

To build the Docker container:
```
cd docker
bash build-docker.sh
```
If running for the first time, compile the ```.mod``` files by running:
```
nrnivmodl
```

## Computational model

The computational model needs to be launched outside from the docker.

Download the necessary packages in the requirements.txt beforehand.

To run the computational model:
```
python MarmosetBG.py
```

## Launch Gazebo Simulation
install and compile the [robotology superbuild](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild) before starting simulation.

 To launch the Gazebo iCub simulation, first initiate the yarp server  : 
```
yarpserver
```

 then in another Command window launch the gazebo simulation : 
```
gazebo tutorial_joint-interface.sdf
```

## Icub pronation-supination movements
Once both Gazebo and Computational model are initiated, run the following command : 
```
python icub.py
```
